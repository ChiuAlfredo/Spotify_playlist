## Background

Spotify always create [only for you] playlist. But, It has limits. First, We can't control when and how it show you.  Second, It can only create the genre which you listen the most frequent. You can listen what you want to explore. Third, I want to create a playlist similar to the specific singer ,but only spotify can't do it. Because of  these reason, I create my own spotify playlist application to fulfill all these needs.
